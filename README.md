# todo-derek-dominicS-georgia

## Background
This project was made as part of the test-driven development part of the Founders and Coders skills bootcamp. We will be utilising the test methods that we have learnt.

## Overview 
This project is a to-do app that allows a user to: 
- Add tasks to a list.
- Check completed tasks off the list.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Use the app without a mouse.

## How to use
Try the app out [here](https://fac26.github.io/todo-derek-dominicS-georgia/).

## How we constructed the app
The user is prompted to enter in a to-do item. We have created a dynamic list item in which the to-do items are pushed, and displayed on the screen. We have created separate functions for pushing into the list item and deleting from the list item.
