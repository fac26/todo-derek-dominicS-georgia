###### For our testing project, we will design a to-app. The user will be prompted to enter in a task in an input field. That inputted to-do task will then be added to an array or object and displayed visually in the main section of the page.
###### Accompanying the to-do list will be a checkbox for each item that the user can tick, so that way they can indicate to themselves that they've completed that task. There will also be a delete button; when the user clicks this, the to-do item will dissapear from the page, indicating that the task has been completed and does not need to be listed.
###### If we have time, we will also add a stretch task, which is an additional section in which those to-do items that are completed are listed so that the user can focus on whatâ€™s left to do; this would be separate to those that the user simply wants to delete.
